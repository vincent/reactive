Reactive
========

A Javascript rules-based contextual dialog system

Reactive is a na√Øve implementation of a contextual dialog system as described by Valve programmers in the presentation [Rule databases for Contextual Dialog and Game Logic](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015317/AI-driven-Dynamic-Dialog-through)

It involves describing a database of dialog lines, and a simple query system to match a well described event with a relevant game logic.
